###Code and Data for Tannenbaum et al. (2015) "Nudging physician prescription decisions by partitioning the order set: Results of a vignette-based study."###

Contains data and STATA analysis scripts for the study reported in Tannenbaum et al. (2015).

This repo contains the following: (1) a raw csv data file (`raw data.csv`); (2) a data file that provides additional demographic data for each participant (`provider network data.csv` and `provider network data.dta`); (3) a STATA cleanup script that merges and prepares the raw data sets for analysis (`cleanup.do`); (3) a prepared/cleaned csv data file (`cleaned data.csv`); (4) a codebook of all variable names in the cleaned data set (`codebook.md`); and (5) a STATA analysis script that executes all of the analyses reported in the paper (`analysis.do` file).

There are two conditions of using any data posted here: (1) If you find an error, please tell me about it (email: davetannenbaum@gmail.com); (2) If you want to publish any analyses on the data you obtain here, the original authors on the project have the right to be included as co-authors on the new paper.
